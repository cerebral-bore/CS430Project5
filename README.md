# CS430Project5

In this project you will create an image viewer. Your image viewer should be able to load PPM
images in P3 or P6 format and display the image in a window. You should also have mouse
and/or keyboard controls to perform all the affine transformations on the image:

• Translate	(pan)

• Rotate

• Scale

• Shear

Your program (ezview) should have this usage pattern: 'ezview input.ppm'
