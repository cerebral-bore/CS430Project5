# CS430Project5

In this project you will create an image viewer. Your image viewer should be able to load PPM
images in P3 or P6 format and display the image in a window. You should also have mouse
and/or keyboard controls to perform all the affine transformations on the image:

• Translate	(pan): Press '1' then use Left, Right, Up and/or Down to move the image.

• Rotate: Press '2' then use Left and/or Right to rotate the image.

• Scale: Press '3' then use Up and/or Down to scale the image up or down, respectively.

• Shear: (Implementing soon)

Your program (ezview) should have this usage pattern: 'ezview input.ppm'
